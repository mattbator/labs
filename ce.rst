Community Edition
=================

Nutanix Community Edition (CE) is a free-of-charge, community supported edition of the Nutanix Enterprise Cloud OS software. CE runs on the Nutanix AHV processor and can be installed on a wide variety of hardware, including non-server platforms. As such, CE has become a popular option for testing and training on the Nutanix.

It is possible to perform many of the labs entirely on top of a single node Nutanix CE cluster. Unfortunately other labs may require alternate hypervisors or additional functionality only offered through commercially available Nutanix software. The **Requirements** page for each individual workshop will indicate if those particular labs can be performed using Nutanix CE.
