Here we're going to be using this baller script to do some stuff, let's take a look:

.. literalinclude:: scripts/helloworld.ps1
   :language: powershell
   :emphasize-lines: 1
   :name: helloworld.ps1
   :caption: helloworld.ps1

And now back to your regularly scheduled stuff

Here's some code that's written inline, and not maintained as part of an external file:

.. code-block:: powershell

    $strString = "Hello World"
    write-host $strString

Subtitle 3

I'm getting yelled at for not helping to hand out Halloween candy, so I'm gonna go do that now.
