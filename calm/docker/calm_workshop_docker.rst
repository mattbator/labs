**Introduction**
****************

Docker is the company driving the container movement and the only container platform provider to address every
application across the hybrid cloud. Todayâ€™s businesses are under pressure to digitally transform but are constrained
by existing applications and infrastructure while rationalizing an increasingly diverse portfolio of clouds, datacenters
and application architectures. Docker enables true independence between applications and infrastructure and developers and
IT ops to unlock their potential and creates a model for better collaboration and innovation.

**Container**

A container image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software that includes everything needed
to run it: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, settings. Available for both Linux and Windows based apps, 
containerized software will always run the same, regardless of the environment. Containers isolate software from its 
surroundings, for example differences between development and staging environments and help reduce conflicts between teams 
running different software on the same infrastructure.
